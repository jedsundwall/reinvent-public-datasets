### [AIM334 - Build Models for Aerial Images Using Amazon SageMaker](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=88725)

[Video](#) | [Slides](#)

There are unique challenges to building highly accurate models that detect small objects in aerial and overhead imagery. In this chalk talk, we dive deep into using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with Amazon SageMaker in order to build and train aerial object detection models. We build advanced models using AWS public datasets, such as SpaceNet and LandSat, as we work with DigitalGlobe's GBDX Notebooks.


### [WPS302 - Best Practices for Working with Large-Scale Geospatial Imagery](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=90201)

[Video](#) | [Slides](#)

Across the commercial and public sectors, companies are working with large geospatial datasets. In this session, we review how to use various services, including Amazon S3, Amazon Glacier, Amazon Athena, AWS Batch, and AWS Step Functions to store, process, and get insights into your large geospatial datasets.


### [AIM428 - Building, Training, and Deploying fast.ai Models Using Amazon SageMaker](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=88751)

[Video](#) | [Slides](#)

In a short space of time, fast.ai has become a popular Deep Learning library, driven by the success of the fast.ai online Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). It has allowed SW developers to achieve, in the span of a few weeks, state-of-the-art results in domains such as Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and structured data machine learning. In this chalk talk, we go into the details of building, training, and deploying fast.ai-based models using Amazon SageMaker.


### [WPS326 - AWS Public Data Sets: How to Stage Petabytes of Data for Analysis in AWS](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=90146)

[Video](#) | [Slides](#)

AWS hosts a variety of public data sets that anyone can access for free. Previously, large data sets such as satellite imagery or genomic data have required hours or days to locate, download, customize, and analyze. When data is made publicly available on AWS, anyone can analyze any volume of data without downloading or storing it themselves. In this session, the AWS Open Data Team shares tips and tricks, patterns and anti-patterns, and tools to help you effectively stage your data for analysis in the cloud.


### [CMP340 - How Jupiter Intel Uses AWS to Forecast Weather Impact & Climate Risk](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=89709)

[Video](#) | [Slides](#)

Jupiter is a cloud-native company that delivers hyperlocal environmental information in a changing climate, primarily using AWS Batch. Through AWS Batch’s capability to execute thousands of scientific modeling jobs while managing scale and cost, Jupiter scientists can focus on data analysis and developing sophisticated machine learning (ML)-based applications to support private sector and local municipality customers; AWS Batch takes care of the rest. In this chalk talk, we demonstrate how AWS Batch, through managing resource provisioning and scheduling, enables flexibility across changing requirements to allow various modeling applications to run quickly and at scale.

### [ARC329 - Massively Parallel Data Processing at Scale](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=88753)

[Video](#) | [Slides](#)

Get hands on with serverless data processing at scale. In this session, we use Landsat 8 satellite imagery to calculate a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) across multiple points of interest in the world using the GeoTIFF data across multiple spectral bands.

### [CMP416 - Build High-Performance, Cloud-Native, Open-Source Apps on AWS & Save](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=91429)

[Video](#) | [Slides](#)

As a leader in agriculture technologies and services, Bayer is using technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), satellite imagery, and sensor data from multiple sources to generate real time insights. Over 300 data sources are ingested into their open source HPC geospatial platform to generate on average 100M API calls per day. The platform is used to provide real-time visualization and computational analysis to Bayer’s internal research community, partners, and is licensed to third-party applications to provide insights relevant to high-yield production of crops. In this session, Mendez-Costabel discusses how Bayer transitioned from on-premises packaged software architecture to open-source software and cloud services from AWS to build a modern, scalable, high-performance, open-source app on AWS. Learn about the open-source application architecture and AWS services used. Learn how the computing environment has changed the way that Bayer is performing R&D projects, and how the move to a modern architecture has enabled Bayer’s customers to gain insights that are transforming their businesses.

### [WPS201 - Build a Genome Clustering Model with Amazon SageMaker](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=90207)

[Video](#) | [Slides](#)

The development and application of machine learning (ML) models is a vital part of scientific and technical computing. Increasing model training data size generally improves model prediction and performance, but deploying models at scale is a challenge. Participants in this builder session learn to use Amazon SageMaker, an AWS service that simplifies the ML process and enables training on cloud-stored datasets at any scale. Attendees walk through the process of building a model, training it, and applying it for prediction against large open scientific datasets, such as the 1000 Genomes data. By the end of the session, attendees have the resources and experience to start using Amazon SageMaker and related AWS services to accelerate their scientific research and time to discovery.

### [WPS201 - Petabytes of Data & No Servers: Corteva Scales DNA Analysis to Meet Increasing Business Demand](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=90797)

[Video](#) | [Slides](#)

Corteva Agriscience, the agricultural division of DowDuPont, produces as much DNA sequence data every six hours as existed in the entire public sphere in 2008. On-premises processing and storage could not scale to meet the business demand. Partnering with Sogeti (part of Capgemini), Corteva replatformed their existing Hadoop-based genome processing systems into AWS using a serverless, cloud-native architecture. In this session, learn how Corteva Agriscience met current and future data processing demands without maintaining any long-running servers by using AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon EMR, AWS Glue, AWS Batch, and more. This session is brought to you by AWS partner, Capgemini America.  

### [FSV309 - Market prediction Using ML: Experiment with Amazon SageMaker and the Deutsche Börse Public Dataset](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=89132)

[Video](#) | [Slides](#)

In this workshop, learn how to use machine learning to analyze the Deutsche Börse Public Dataset, which consists of trade data aggregated to one-minute intervals from the Tradex and Eurex engines, comprising a variety of equities, funds, and derivative securities. The public dataset provides initial price, lowest price, highest price, final price, and volume for every minute of the trading day, and for every tradeable security. Learn how to apply a variety of ML models to the data to find patterns and methods to predict price movements or identify trends in the market. Also learn how to interact with data staged for analysis in Amazon S3, use AWS Glue to transform data into analysis-ready formats, and use Amazon SageMaker and Amazon EC2 to experiment with a variety of ML models to derive insights from the data.
